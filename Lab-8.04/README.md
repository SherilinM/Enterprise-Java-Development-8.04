## Reactive Forms and Angular Material Lab (8.04)
### Requirements
You are creating a sneaker brand application using Angular. Your application must:

1. Allow users to add a new sneaker model.
2. Every sneaker must-have model name (string), price (number), special edition (boolean), author (string), creation date (Date), and artist collaborator (string).
3. Every field must be validated. Artist collaborator is an optional field but if is a special edition it must have an artist collaborator.
4. When a new sneaker is created you have to store it in a database and show it on a list page. Note: You can skip this step by adding it to a list below the form for simplicity.
5. You have to use material components in the design.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
